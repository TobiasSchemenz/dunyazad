Procedure for generating input:

1. For each condition, generate 3 inputs: one with each of the following three
setups: monster_attack, threatened_innocents, and market.
  - Caveat: If a result contains a shift_blame action where the target of the
    action is not "guilty" (i.e., threatening or accusing someone) then the
    input will be re-rolled with the same setup. Re-rolls may happen multiple
    times in a row if necessary.
  - Corrections: The English "<person> been wrongly accused" was changed by
    hand to "<person> has been wrongly accused" in some cases; the base file
    has been updated to produce this result automatically in the future.
