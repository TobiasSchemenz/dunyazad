Arel bumped into someone and stumbled to the ground.
"Watch where you're walking, waif!" and the stranger moved on, no sympathy for a dusty beggar dressed in rags.
Picking herself up, she limped along, skirting the grand market of Ulms-Iber on side-streets where beggars were tolerated.
A lanky teen wearing a tattered robe and head-wrap, she attracted little notice from the people of the city: Just another vagrant, another sign of the times.
She in turn paid them little mind, too focused on her own bleak thoughts.

She hated the city, nothing but dust and closed doors.
She hated the people who turned away, too uncomfortable to even look at her.
Even those who offered her money were hesitant, as if she might somehow betray their paltry "trust." 
Mixed with hatred was an exhausting cloud of despair.
Nothing to look forward to, only problems in the future.
As bleak as her present condition was, where would she be a year from now, or five?
That thought kept sticking in her head, and the conclusion was inevitable: she'd still be wandering the streets, still working for the King.
Not King Mera of Kolum of course, but the King of Muck, Lom the One-Eyed, Master of Crooked Alleys.

She hefted the purse she had lifted from the stranger earlier and knocked twice on an unmarked door.
The shutter opened and closed, and then the door did the same, leaving the alley empty.

"Catch any fish?" the words were quiet but firm.

Arel silently dropped the purse into an outstretched hand.

"Stay in for a while then. Wouldn't want anyone to mistake you for a thief."

Arel went down the hallway to the back room, ignoring the sounds of laughter from the tavern in the front.
She sat down on a cot and closed her eyes.
These hours spent confined in the dark back room were perhaps the least favorite part of her days.
At least out on the streets she had something to occupy her mind, scanning the crowds for targets and reeling in her "catch."
