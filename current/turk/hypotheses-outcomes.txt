Conditions (stakes in all cases are high):

1. Positive alternatives choice (every option indicates success) with expected
   success outcomes.

2. Positive alternatives choice with unexpected failure outcomes.

3. Obvious choice (one option indicates success, the rest indicate failure)
   with expected success (best) and expected failure (other) outcomes.
   (main) - participants who chose the obvious option.
   (alt) - participants who chose a different option.

4. Obvious choice with unexpected failure (best) and unexpected success (other)
   outcomes.
   (main) - participants who chose the obvious option.
   (alt) - participants who chose a different option.

5. Negative alternatives choice with expected failure outcomes.

6. Negative alternatives choice with unexpected success outcomes.


Option questions (opt-#):

opt-1. There is a clear best option at this choice.
opt-2. The options at this choice are all about equally good (or bad).
opt-3. There are no bad options at this choice.
opt-4. None of the options at this choice are good.
opt-5. The stakes for this choice are low.

Outcome questions (out-#):

out-1. Given the options available, the outcome I got is fair.
out-2. The outcome that I got makes sense given the option that I selected.
out-3. I got a bad outcome.
out-4. I'm happy with the option that I chose.
out-5. The outcome that I got is unfair, given the options available.
out-6. The outcome that I got is completely unexpected.
out-7. There is an outcome.
out-8. There might be a problem with this choice--the outcome I got does not
       make sense.
out-9. The outcome that I got is a good outcome.
out-10. I pretty much expected the outcome that I got.
out-11. I wish I had chosen a different option.

Outcome question pairs compose the following categories:

out-fair: out-1 (agree); out-5 (disagree)
out-sense: out-2 (agree); out-8 (disagree)
out-good: out-3 (disagree); out-9 (agree)
out-satisfied: out-4 (agree); out-11 (disagree)
out-expected: out-6 (disagree); out-10 (agree)

Motive questions (mtv-#):

mtv-1. Which of the following motive(s) contributed to your decision? (pick one or more)
  a)I'm taking an online survey. I just chose an option quickly so that I could
    complete the survey.
  b)I was just curious to find out what would happen if I chose the option I
    did.
  c)I imagined a character in the story situation and chose what that character
    would do.
  d)I chose what I would have chosen were I in the situation described in the
    story.
  e)I chose the option that I thought would lead to the most
    interesting/satisfying result.
  f I looked at the skill information and chose the option that I thought would
    be most successful.
  g)Other (please explain).

mtv-2. Which of the following judgement(s) contributes to how you generally define a &quot;good&quot; outcome in interactive experiences like the one you just played? (pick one or more)
  a)I feel an outcome is good when something good happens to my character in
    the story world.
  b)I feel an outcome is good if it is an interesting development in the story.
  c)I feel an outcome is good when it fits the role that I am building for my
    character.
  d)I feel an outcome is good when it makes my character more powerful.
  e)I feel an outcome is good when it makes progress towards beating a game.
  f)Other (please explain).

mtv-3. Which of the following judgement(s) contributes to how you generally define a &quot;bad&quot; outcome in interactive experiences like the one you just played? (pick one or more)
  a)I feel an outcome is bad when something bad happens to my character in the
    story world.
  b)I feel an outcome is bad if it is boring or if it makes the plot worse.
  c)I feel an outcome is bad when my character doesn't do what I expected them
    to do.
  d)I feel an outcome is bad when my character expresses a value or opinion
    that is different from what I wanted them to express.
  e)I feel an outcome is bad when it makes my character less powerful.
  f)I feel an outcome is bad when it prevents me from making progress towards
    beating a game.
  g)Other (please explain):.

mtv-4. Do you feel you approach all interactive experiences (e.g., Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novels, video games, tabletop role-playing games, etc.) with a consistent set of motivations and judgements, or do your motivations and judgements change from story to story?
  a)I feel that my motivations and judgements are the same no matter what
    interactive story I'm playing.
  b)I feel that my motivations and judgements change from story to story.
  c)I don't play interactive stories often enough to have a definite answer.
  d)Other (please explain):

    

Hypothesis format is:

[condition(s)][question(s)]: hypothesis

Hypotheses marked with a '*' are low-confidence.

    best option." (the satisficer's regret)
