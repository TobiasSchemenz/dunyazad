Noah:
  Start with something that provokes curiosity.
  -> how would you satisfy that curiosity no matter the player's choice.
  You don't have to reason *everywhere* (cheat in some places).
  Tough question:
    Where does choice come in?
      -> You are Scheherazade: keep the story going and the audience interested.
  Douglass Fairbanks (1920's actor)
  The Thief of Baghdad
    -> First ways that these stories came over. 
  Investigate extra-textual stories.

  Quarter goal:
   Submit a workshop paper to INT about the structure of 1001 nights stories.
     -> A critique of the fable as the prototypical story.
     -> Other people have worked on things like suspense; I'm working on
       curiosity which is new.
   End-to-end stupid generator.
