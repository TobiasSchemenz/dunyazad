A story generation system (with choices(!)).

At some point we'll have a real README :P

Run "main.py" in "current/". Look at the bottom of that file for the options
that are available. If you're on Windows, you'll probably need to pass the
--*-exe options to specify where to find external programs, unless you've put
things like clingo on your path.

Required external programs:

  clingo - used to solve answer sets! This is absolutely required.

  twine (twee compiler) - needed if you used the "twine" format. Unfortunately
    there aren't any other nice output formats at the moment unless you happen
    to have Choicescript around and know how to set that up. You could use the
    "example" format ('-x' flag; see main.py for how it works) to get html for
    the options of a single choice, but that won't give you a whole story.

  graphviz - needed for visualizing the story graph. You can just pass --no-viz
    to skip this step if you don't have graphviz.
